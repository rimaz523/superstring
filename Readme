Overview
---------
This is an implementation for finding the Shortest Common Superstring for a set 
of substrings using greed match and merge.

To look at how things work, simply open up index.html and start adding your text
fragments. Once you are done with adding the strings, click on "Compute Superstring"
to find the shortest common superstring for your text fragments.

-------------------
Clone this project to your web root directory. Then access it in your browser
as localhost/<app-root>
(alternatively you can simply clone it to any directory of your choice, 
right-click on index.html and open with your preferred browser as this is written
using vanilla javascript & html.)

Note : you can view the QUnit tests written for the superstring algorigthm by 
opening/accessing tests.html.
